# Coral Colony Geometry and Growth

## Overview

Welcome to the Coral Colony Geometry and Growth research project repository. In this project, we explore the fascinating world of clonal organisms, specifically reef-building corals. These organisms exhibit a diverse range of colony morphologies and geometric shapes, which have profound physiological and ecological implications.

## Project Description

Coral colony geometry plays a pivotal role in dictating the relationships between various growth parameters, such as volume, surface area, and length, as well as the processes of biomass production and calcification. Understanding these mathematical relationships can help us determine which aspects of growth are size-dependent or size-independent in reef-building corals.

Traditionally, coral linear extension rates have been assumed to be size-independent. However, we've discovered that even with a constant calcification rate, extension rates can vary with colony size due to the geometry of the coral. This variation is influenced by the ratio between mass and surface area, which can either remain constant or change as the colony size increases.

We have observed that different geometric shapes in corals lead to unique relationships between biomass production (proportional to surface area productivity) and calcification (proportional to volume). This relationship contributes to a species' life history strategy and has significant ecological implications.

For example, thin-diameter branching corals maximize growth in surface area and resource acquisition potential but require high biomass production to cover the fast growth in surface area. On the other hand, large hemispheroidal corals are constrained by calcification and grow surface area relatively slowly, allowing a surplus capacity for biomass production.

One of the key findings of this research is that the rate of surface area growth rapidly decreases as the colony size of hemispheroidal corals increases. This ontogenetic relationship underlies the success of microfragmentation, a technique used to accelerate the restoration of coral cover.
