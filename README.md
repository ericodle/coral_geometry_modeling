## Overview

This repository is supplemental to the research article " Coral Geometry and Why It Matters". In this project, we explore the growth dynamics of reef-building corals. These organisms exhibit a diverse range of colony morphologies and geometric shapes, which have profound physiological and ecological implications.

## Project Description

Coral colony geometry plays a pivotal role in dictating the relationships between various growth parameters, such as volume, surface area, and length, as well as the processes of biomass production and calcification. Understanding these mathematical relationships can help us determine which aspects of growth are size-dependent in reef-building corals.

Traditionally, coral linear extension rates have been assumed to be size-independent. However, we have learned that even with a constant calcification rate, extension rates can vary with colony size due to the geometry of the coral. This variation is influenced by the ratio between mass and surface area, which can either remain constant or change as the colony size increases. Moreover, different geometric shapes in corals lead to unique relationships between biomass production (proportional to surface area productivity) and calcification (proportional to volume). This relationship impacts survival strategy and has significant ecological implications. 

For example, thin-diameter branching corals maximize growth in surface area and resource acquisition potential but require high biomass production to cover rapid surface area expansion. Conversely, large hemispheroidal corals are constrained by calcification and therefore expand their surface area at a relatively slow rate. Indeed, a key finding from this study is that the rate of surface area growth rapidly decreases as the colony size of hemispheroidal corals increases.
